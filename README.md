Trader Note — Collaborative Trade Journal & Strategy Platform
Project Overview

Trader Note is a full-stack, web-based application designed for individual traders and trading teams to document, analyze, and share their trades in a collaborative environment. Built using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend, Trader Note offers advanced account management with role-based access control, trade journaling enriched with confirmations and strategies, and the ability to securely share trades publicly via generated links.

This platform enables traders to manage multiple trading accounts, invite team members with customizable permissions, and maintain a centralized repository of trades with rich metadata and multimedia attachments. Trader Note bridges the gap between a personal trading journal and a professional collaborative platform, empowering traders to improve decision-making through structured note-taking and strategic analysis.

Key Features
1. Multi-User Accounts with Role-Based Permissions

Traders create or join multiple accounts (representing portfolios or trading groups).

Each account supports multiple users with assigned roles:

Admin: Can invite/remove users, assign permissions, and manage account settings.

Member: Can view, add, or edit trades based on granted permissions.

Permissions can be configured per user to allow either full access (add/edit) or view-only access.

Role-based access ensures secure and controlled collaboration.

2. Trade Management & Documentation

Users can create, view, and edit trades linked to their accounts.

Trades support attaching:

Images (e.g., screenshots of charts or trade confirmations).

Confirmations — documents or notes verifying trade details.

Trades can have notes for in-depth analysis and commentary.

3. Strategy Library

Users can define and manage trading strategies with detailed descriptions.

Trades can be tagged or linked to one or more strategies, enabling pattern recognition and performance tracking.

4. Public Trade Sharing

Traders can share individual trades publicly by generating unique, shareable links.

Publicly shared trades can be viewed by anyone with the link without logging in.

Owners retain full control to manage and revoke public access to any shared trade at any time.

This feature supports collaboration, mentorship, or showcasing performance.

5. Powerful Search, Filtering, and Sorting

Trades can be searched and filtered by various criteria: date ranges, strategies, tags, trade status, etc.

Sorting options help users quickly find relevant trades and analyze performance trends.

6. Dashboard & Analytics (Future Expansion)

Overview dashboards to summarize account activity, trading performance, and strategy effectiveness.

Visualization of win/loss ratios, trade frequency, and other key metrics.
